    "This notebook demonstrates fairness and energy consumption monitoring in a single-run OSS pipeline. The used open-source GitHub repositories for enabling this monitoring are:  \n",

    "- Data: https://github.com/socialfoundations/folktables\n",
    "- Fairness: https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360\n",
    "- Energy consumption: https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre\n",
    "\n",
    "The used data is 2014 US Census PUMS data (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata.html) from California, which is preprocessed into an ACSIncome format by Folktables suite. This aims to replicate a prediction task standardized in ML fairness research by the widely used UCI Adult Dataset. The task is to make a model which predicts using the available features if an individual has an income higher than $50 000 (Give 0 for no and give 1 for yes) in the column PINCP. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sensitive attributes of this data are age (AGEP), gender (SEX), and ethnicity (RAC1P) with encodings found here: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/pums/data_dict/PUMS_Data_Dictionary_2014-2018.pdf. In this simple demonstration we will set the privileged group as white men under 50 ([{\"AGEP\":1, \"SEX\": 1, \"RAC1P\": 1}]), and the unprivileged group as non-white women over 50 ([{\"AGEP\":0, \"SEX\": 0, \"RAC1P\": 0}]), so the binarization thresholds are 50 for AGEP, 1 for SEX, and 1 for RAC1P. AIF enables setting up more distinct groups by adding more dict elements into privileged or unprivileged groups, like {'AGEP': 1}. For this reason, the resulted scores for these groups should be seen only as a technical demonstration and nothing else."

    "Before we run the pipeline, we will need to set up Scaphander, Prometheus alerts and Grafana dashboard to handle metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "To setup Scaphandre,we will use the following official documentation in the given order to get the required commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kubernetes: https://hubblo-org.github.io/scaphandre-documentation/tutorials/kubernetes.html\n",
    "- Prometheus: https://hubblo-org.github.io/scaphandre-documentation/references/exporter-prometheus.html\n",
    "- Grafana: https://hubblo-org.github.io/scaphandre-documentation/how-to_guides/get-process-level-power-in-grafana.html\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first need to clone the Scaphandre GitHub Repository with the command 'git clone https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre'. I cloned it into the folder where I stored the OSS clone, but it should be fine if it is anywhere else. When the cloning is done, call the command 'cd scaphandre', check that helm is installed with 'helm version', and then call 'helm install scaphandre helm/scaphandre'. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it might be required that you change the default port value of 8080 from 8081 in 'scaphandre/helm/scaphandre/values.yaml' as seen in the provided 'modified-scaphandre-values.yaml' before doing the last step because it is the same port used by KFP, Kserve, and Prometheus. If you want to run Scaphandre with modified YAML, delete it with Helm using the command 'helm delete scaphandre' ('helm list' to confirm the name) and rerun the install command. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can check that Scahpandre configuration by running 'kubectl get pods' and then 'kubectl describe pod (pod name),' which should show under containers and Port that 8081/TCP. A faster way of doing this is 'kubectl get services.' To get Scahpandre to send metrics to Prometheus, we need to go into the pod with 'kubectl exec -it (pod name) -- /bin/bash' and then run 'scaphandre prometheus --port 8081'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no errors are given, the setup is ready, and Prometheus should be able to query the energy consumption metrics. The Prometheus exporter can be made to run with 'scaphandre prometheus', but this will create errors due to the already used port. If the correct setup starts to throw errors unrelated to used port either due to nonoptimal configuration or unsuitable Prometheus query, restart it with CTRL + C and rerun the starting command.\n",
    "\n",
    "To setup Prometheus alerts for fairness metrics, we must modify the default 'prometheus-config-map.yaml' to have fairness alerts. It is recommended that the default YAML is first moved somewhere safe, after which the provided 'fairness-alert-prometheus-config-map.yaml' is renamed into 'prometheus-config-map.yaml'. Now we only need to run 'kubectl apply -k deployment/monitoring', 'kubectl rollout\n",
    "restart deployment/prometheus-deployment -n monitoring' and wait a bit to apply these modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "To setup the Grafana dashboard for fairness and energy consumption metrics, we only need to click import under create and upload the provided JSON file named 'grafana_fairness_consumption_monitoring_1.json'. The dashboard will be empty, except for Prometheus alerts and consumption plots until the KFP pipeline has completed evaluation step. As long as Prometheus is capable of querying fairness and energy consumption metrics after running the KFP, Grafana should also be fine."

    "Here we create a component that defines the used metrics, makes the datasets suitable for AIF360 metrics (with a favorable label of 1 and unfavorable label of 0), trains a logistic regression model, calculates metrics, and stores these metrics into MLflow for model comparison. Some of the code is reused from the original OSS pipeline. The used fairness metrics are statistical parity, disparate impact, equal odds difference, average odds difference, and theil index fairness metrics, which are the most common in the provided AIF360 tutorials. Notice that there are fewer dataset metrics than model metrics."

For some reason, running this KFP pipeline creates temporary mystery files with a size range of [2,5] GB, which enable_caching, metadata writing, artifacts, or in optimal docker configuration might cause. On their own, these files are not a problem, but if a computer has a set memory space of 105 GB for the root file system that has around 20GB free space left due to it being the default place for all kinds of software, the user needs to either manually delete these files (possible places for these files in ubuntu 22.04 are /tmp and /run based on date modification) or restart the computer after running KFP around 4-5 times to continue rerunning the pipeline.

Similarly, we can get the KFP (except for inference steps) power consumption with the query sum(scaph_process_power_consumption_microwatts{app_kubernetes_io_managed_by=\"Helm\", cmdline =~\".*kfp.*\"}) / 1000000 by using regex.\n",

The instance label could provide even better granularity if the cluster IP addresses are stable. The most specific label is PID, which is, unfortunately, unique for all processes. There are other ways through the cmdline, which allows specifying KFP components (except for inference steps)  by putting landmark variables. So, for example, the power consumption of running the code for every component execpt inference can be queried with sum(scaph_process_power_consumption_microwatts{app_kubernetes_io_managed_by=\"Helm\", cmdline =~\".*landmark.*\"}) / 1000000.

    "Unfortunately, these filters are not agnostic. They use code-specific regex matches, which means the substring negations must be updated for modified code. This problem can be fixed by properly configuring Scaphander into the cluster because it is currently in an awkward place due to requiring manual actions and not being able to get more relevant label metadata. Additionally, in the Grafana plots the sum(sum_over_time({}[1d])) / (1000000 * 1000 * 24) only approximates the cumulated daily energy consumption per hour without thinking about possible downtime, which is why sum_over_time(avg_over_time(avg())) might be a better option."
